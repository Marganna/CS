Non Voltage Random Acces Memories [NVRAM]

A NVRAM is a type of memory which retains the information after powering off the power supply.

Virtual Memory

Method to extending RAM capacity[extention is called pagefile, can be read from the hard disk as
contigious part => faster than re-reading data from many different original loctions]. Virtual 
memory is a porion of the computer's hard drive is put aside for scratch partition[Created on a 
target device that has sufficient space avilable] or pageing file, and combincated with physical 
RAM and the paging file from the system's total memory.

Memory Cell

Is a circuit that stores one bit of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 [high
voltage level]and reset to store a logic 0. it's value is stored untill it is changed by the 
set/reset process and is able to be accessed by reading it.
Multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells.Several memory cells share 
the same address.  

EEPROM [E^ROM]==electrically erasable[erased by ultraviolet light & programmed again with new data]
programmable read-only memory.

Type of non-voltatile[NVM recovers stored information [unlike volatile memory-needs constant power] 
after power cycled [turned off & back]] memory used in computers to store relatively small amount of
data allowing individual byted to be erased & programmed[unlike the Flash-some region in the device at once]
as an array of floating-gate transistors.This option slows down but some EEPROMs allow multy-byte 
page operations having limited life for erasing and programming =>the design is important, to consider 
the limitations.
