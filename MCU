N-bit ADC or N-bit DAC , N regfers to the resolution. For the ADC it refers to the number of
bits the ADC outputs at each sapling time, in case of DAC it refers to the number of the 
input.
2^N == the number of levels in which the amplitide of the analog signal is divided. E.G. if
N==5 => ther are 32 levels. 5-bit inputs.

Number of channels

So 16  analog inputs must be digitized with 20 bit resolution,process them into an FPGA
let say. 16 ADCs could be used in parallel, for each input 1, or just using 20-bit ADC
preced by an analog multiplexer which has 16 inputs selexted by 4-bit control signal.
Based on the value of the control signal the input is selected and sent to the ADC,
which produced a 20-bit output at each sampling time.
