On The Fly == describes activities that develop or occur dynamically rather than result 
of something like predefined. Based on dinamic factors.

Just-in-time compilation [Dynamic translation / run-time compilation]

Is a type of computer code execution which involves compilation during execution of a program at run time
non prior to the execution. JIT is a combination of translation into machine code => 
[ahead-of-time compilation [AOT==act of compiling a higher level programming language into a native [
system-dependent] machine code] + interpretation] => combines speed of compiled code with the flexibility
of interpretation.JIT is applied to some programs and can be used for certain capacities, especially to 
dynamic ones, s.t. regualar expressions. LIke tet editor may compile a regular expression provided runtime
to machine code to allow faster matching, which could not be ahead of runtime, the pattern provided only 
at runtime => could not be ahead of run time[the time during program is running]. ;) JIT mostly consists of 
souce code or bytecode[numeric codes,constants,references [numeric addresses] which encodes the result of 
compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis to machine code[executed directly].] 

Dynamic compilation

Used by a programming language to make execution during implementations.

Incremental compilation [used POP-11,POP-2...]

Makes source code readable at any time from the terminal,from data structure, file
constrcted by the running program.
