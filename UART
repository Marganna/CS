Universal Asyncronous Resiver and Transmitter

Is a circuit which sends parallel data through a serial line serial communication == process of sending data 
one bit at a time, sequentially over a comunication channel or computer bus [ in telecomunication and data 
transmition].Communication occurs serial in most computers and networks as
1. Coast of cables.
2. Syncronisation several different systems, with parallel it is impractical.

UART includes 


A transmitter [I guess PHY circuit included]  - essentially shift register which loads transmistion
starts with a start bit which is  followed by data bits and an optional parity bit = for error detection
and ends with stop bit which is 1. Odd parity bit is set to 0 when the data bits have odd number of 1's.
Odd number of 1's => parity set 0.Prity bit checks the transmition bit set, total numbers of ones, to 
check if that combination is od or even at both sides.

Before the transmition starts, the transmiter and receiver must agree with parameters, to exchange info
about parameters in advance. One of them is the boud rate [e.g.number of bits per second], the number of
start bit and end bit, aslo the parity bit. [19,200 naud rate, 8data bits, 1 stop bit, and nor parity bit.

UART receiving subsystem

Since no clock information exists [as mentioned above exchange of parameters occur],=> use oversampling
scheme [which could be used as clock, indicates when the input signal is valid] to obtaim middle ponts 
of transmitted bits and then retrieve them at these points. 
	
	In signal processing oversampling is a process of sampling a signal with a sampling frequency
	significally higher than the nyquist rate [harry nyquist].Oversampling used
	1. To reduce the noise
	2. Helps avoid aliasing and phase distortion by relaxing anti aliasing[2 & more diff signals bacome
	indistinguish]  filter
	3. Improves resolution
	Bandwidth == the difference between highest frequency and the lowest one, inside the continuse set
	of frequencies measured in hertz. It is also the limiting of a signal frequency domain.
 Oversampling Procedure


Idle state ==  not being used by any programm

Every program occupies certain amount of processing time on the CPU.

So idle used 
1. to save power
2. reduces the clock speed along CPU voltage and sending parts sleep mode loaded by OS scheduler
	3. could be defined as a seperate task
	4. hard coded
	5. the number of stop bit could be set 1 or 1.5 or2.
